<h1>Harry Potter Game Review</h1>
<p>The good and the bad.</p>
<h2><strong>The Good</strong></h2>
<p>The good thing about this game is that if you're playing with someone else, you both know spells so you can have something like a mini battle where you and the other person each try to hit each other with spells.</p>
<h2><strong>The Bad</strong></h2>
<p>The bad thing about this game is that some parts of the game can get confusing and difficult.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2>
<p>If you like legos and thinking a lot and you have quite a bit of patience, then I think this game would be good for you. If you don't have that stuff, I think a different game might be better for you. I'm just saying. </p>
