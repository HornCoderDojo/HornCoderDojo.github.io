<h1>Ready to race?</h1>
<p>Here are 3 pro tips for playing Mario Kart 8.</p>
 <ol>
<li><strong>Tip 1: Make your bob-ombs go further by holding zl or l</strong></li>
<p>In battle mode if you ever get a bob-omb, you can hold zl or l so your bob-omb will go further. This allows you to stay away from other players, but still target them. Close range can be dangerous, so this pro tip helps you get your opponents at far range.</p>
<li><strong>Tip 2: Make sharp turns by holding zr or r.</strong></li>
<p>This tip can be used in any play mode - both racing and battle mode. The longer you hold it, the more boost you'll get when you release the button. Seeing sparks? That's a good sign a boost is coming your way. Better turns with a boost at the end. Go!</p>
<li><strong>Tip 3: Get a faster start by holding A during the countdown</strong></li>
<p>This trick can also be used in battle or racing mode. The most important thing is to hold A at the right time. During the '3, 2, 1' countdown to start, hold A right after the countdown passes '2'. Remember it this way: '3, 2, hold A, 1, go!'</p>
