<h1>Let's go Mario!</h1>
<p>Here are 3 pro tips for playing Mario Odyssey.</p>
 <ol>
<li><strong>Tip 1: Fight enemies with a hat spin by shaking your controller</strong></li>
<p>You can do this whenever you want, but especially when you need to clear out the space around you. For example, maybe you need to knock out goombas around you.</p>
<li><strong>Tip 2: Find where you need to ground pound by following any dog with a hat.</strong></li>
<p>There aren't too many, but when you find one, it might lead you to a location where you can get power moons.</p>
<li><strong>Tip 3: Ground pound</strong></li>
<p>Do a ground pound by jumping with A or B and then pressing zl or zr. This can help you knock out goombas or collect power moons that the dog with a hat leads you to.</p>
</ol>
